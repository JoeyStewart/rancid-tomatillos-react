# Rancid Tomatillos - Joey, Deanna, Dan

## Abstract:

Rancid Tomatillos is a project that focuses on building a user friendly display for recently released movies. A user can 'click' a movie to reveal more details about it. We focused our efforts on creating an easy to read, easy to use, web app for the user while using new techniques like, web responsiveness, protoTypes usage, Cypress testing, and React to flesh out this project in a timely manner. 

Web development tools, including React and Cypress, were used to streamline our project to allow us take on more robust challenges. Implementing React allow us to manipulate the DOM in quick and decisive actions so that our application can react to those changes on a near intantanous level, without the need to manipulate the DOM directly as with past projects.

Rancid Tomatillos consists of multiple iterations, focusing on different aspects of data processing and dashboard display, including movie presentation, displaying individual movie details, routing to display unique URL paths for each movie, and the implementation of a responsive website design that can adapt to changing webpage sizes. It encourages fetching data from provided endpoints instead of hardcoded data files.

The project also provides an extension option for building a robust testing suite using Cypress, ensuring the project's quality and functionality. In summary, Rancid Tomatillos aims to deliver a user-friendly movie infomation webpage for displaying data while fostering collaboration and professionalism among team members.

## Preview of App:



## Context:
This was the first group project in Mod 3 that we had to assemble. We used fetch requests pull data so that we manipulate it into the display that we desired and allow it to popluate it onto the movies display page the movie's details page. We had 11 days to complete the project and spent about 60 cumulatively hours working collaboratively. Part of the difficulty of the project came from learning new concepts such as React, routing, and Cypress testing. Then having to utilize them immediately. Even in spite of this, the project remained on schedule with little delays.

## Learning Goals:

* Use routing, fetch calls, and useState to work the data into a way that satisfies all expectations.

* Create a user interface that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way.

* Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity

* Implement a robust testing suite using Cypress.

* Make network requests to retrieve data.

* Collaborate productively and professionally as a team. Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project.

## Major Wins:
### Joey:
Being able to use CSS along with the creation of a resposive website was very rewarding. CSS is something that I have struggled with in the past, and I have used it extensively for this project. I do feel my skills have been very much strengthened in this area. I am very satisfied with the look of the project and how it can morph and change with the responsive design. I much more confident going forward in this area.

## Challenges and How We Overcame Them:
### Joey:
Understanding routing is a challenge. It looked so simple on its onset, but I quickly learned that it really has to be used in mind from the start of the project instead of implementing it mid-way through. I relied on cohort members and mentors to provide guidance as well as referring back to past assignements and class projects. It allowed me to learn much more about React than I anticipated at first due to my pure inexperience with routing. All in the end, I learned a lot and look forward to properly using it in the future.
